# A Simple Quiz App

I created this simple quiz application as a learning tool to practice handling conditional statements in C#. The app presents a series of questions with multiple-choice answers. By selecting an answer, users interact with the app, which then calculates and displays their score and percentage at the end of the quiz.

Features:
Questions displayed with images.
Multiple-choice answers for user selection.
Score and percentage calculation at the end of the quiz.
Option to restart the quiz.
Purpose:
This project is my personal initiative to gain hands-on experience with conditional statements in C#. It demonstrates how to manage user input and control the program's flow based on various conditions.

## Roadmap

- Additional browser support

- Add more integrations


## Optimizations

What optimizations did you make in your code? E.g. refactors, performance improvements, accessibility

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact about this project is that building this quiz app was a blast! I stumbled over a few mistakes with images and buttons, which made for some funny debugging moments. Every time I fixed an issue, I learned something new about coding. It was like a mini-adventure figuring out how to make everything work just right!
