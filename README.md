# A Simple Quiz App

I created this simple quiz application as a learning tool to practice handling conditional statements in C#. The app presents a series of questions with multiple-choice answers. By selecting an answer, users interact with the app, which then calculates and displays their score and percentage at the end of the quiz.

# Features
. Questions displayed with images.

.Multiple-choice answers for user selection.

.Score and percentage calculation at the end of the quiz.

.Option to restart the quiz.

# Purpose
This project is my personal initiative to gain hands-on experience with conditional statements in C#. 
It demonstrates how to manage user input and control the program's flow based on various conditions.



## Optimizations

.I built a straightforward quiz app using C# and Windows Forms, featuring 5 questions with 4 answer choices each. 

.To optimize the code, I refactored it for better readability and maintainability. 

.I improved performance by optimizing how questions and answers are handled and displayed. 

.For accessibility, I ensured that keyboard navigation is smooth and that all labels are properly linked with their controls. 

.Finally, I enhanced the user experience with a simple and clean not so good design.

‚ö°Ô∏è Fun fact about this project is that building this quiz app was a blast! I stumbled over a few mistakes with images and buttons, which made for some funny debugging moments. Every time I fixed an issue, I learned something new about coding. It was like a mini-adventure figuring out how to make everything work just right!
